# Image Forgery Detection Using CNN

This project implements a deep learning–based approach to detect forged and manipulated images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Digital Image Processing
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras

## Project Overview
Image forgery is a common cybercrime involving manipulation of digital images.  
This project aims to classify images as authentic or tampered by learning visual patterns using CNN-based feature extraction.

## Methodology
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- CNN model training for feature extraction
- Binary classification of authentic vs forged images
- Performance evaluation on test images
